Create a backend API for a recipe sharing platform, enabling users to perform CRUD operations on recipes. The aim is to demonstrate proficiency in developing a robust RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and a database system, while incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
Requirements: Node.js, Express.js, Database system with sample data
Models:
User Class: Represents individuals who interact with the platform. Implement methods for user authentication, profile management, and interaction with recipes.
Recipe Class: Contains details of a recipe, including title, description, ingredients, instructions, and optional images. Implement methods for CRUD operations on recipes.
Database Implementation:
Choose a suitable database system and set up the database.
Design schemas for User and Recipe models.
Populate the database with sample data for Users and Recipes.
Functionality:
User Class Functionality:
Implement methods for user registration, login, and profile management.
Ensure proper validation and error handling for user-related operations.
Incorporate authentication mechanisms such as JWT token generation and validation.
Recipe Class Functionality:
Implement methods for CRUD operations on recipes.
Ensure proper validation and error handling for recipe-related operations.
Utilize encapsulation to interact with the database within the Recipe class methods.
Additional Routes Functionality:
Create routes for user registration, login, and profile management, utilizing methods from the User class.
Create routes for CRUD operations on recipes, utilizing methods from the Recipe class.
Implement authentication middleware to secure API endpoints.
Documentation:
Develop a README file providing instructions for setting up and using the API.
Document the API endpoints, including expected request and response formats.
Include examples of API requests and responses, highlighting the usage of User and Recipe class methods.
Provide information on how OOP concepts are utilized in the project and their benefits.
Deployment and Submission:
Deploy the backend API on a cloud platform.
Provide a live link to the deployed API for testing and evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality: All API endpoints must function correctly, facilitating CRUD operations on Users and Recipes using class methods.
